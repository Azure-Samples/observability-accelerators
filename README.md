# Observability Accelerators

This repository contains multiple samples that are meant to accelerate development in the Observability and Monitoring space on Azure.

Each accelerator focuses on a different application architecture. They contain all source code and infrastructure as code necessary to deploy the application, as well as in-depth documentation that details important O&M concepts.

Navigate to one of the accelerators in the list below. The README will include instructions on how to get started with that application.
